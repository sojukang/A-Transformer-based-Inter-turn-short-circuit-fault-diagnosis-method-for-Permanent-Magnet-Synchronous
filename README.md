# Detection of inter-turn short circuit fault in PMSM using SVM and negative sequence current


A binary classification of inter-turn short fault in PMSMs using SVM model.

PMSMs(Permanent magnet synchronous machines) are widely used nowdays especially EVs(Electric Vehecles). because its superier capabilities of High Torque, rotational speed, efficiency. 

but in these harshy conditions, PMSMs are easily become fault conditions. Winding faults most commonly occured in PMSMs. Winding fualts consist of 3 mechanisms: inter-turn short circuits, phase-to-phase short circuits, phase-to-ground shorts. 

Detection of inter-turn short circuits are very important because those faults easily evolve to other short circuit faults.
